\begin{frame}\frametitle{Linear Mixed Models}
The results from a linear model are reliant on the model assumptions being met and in all examples
investigated this was the case. In research there is data that do not meet these requirements, or
that are not complete, or arise from more complex experiments. These data can be analysed using Linear
Mixed Models (LMM) using much the same process as previously used. A LMM can be used instead of linear models, the
mathematics behind the model is quite different to a linear model but the results will be equivalent.

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Linear Mixed Models}
A LMM has combines two models into one, a \textbf{fixed model} and a \textbf{random model}.
The fixed is used to describe the explanatory structure of the experiment and the random is
used to describe the structural component of the experiment.

\vspace{0.5cm}

In the first part of this chapter some of the previous examples will be revisited and analysed using a LMM approach.
ASReml-R \cite{asremlr} is used as the tool to analyse the data using the function \texttt{asreml}.

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Example 3}
The linear mixed model that is fit can be symbolically written as:
\begin{eqnarray*}
	\texttt{Response variable}&:& \texttt{Yield} \\
	\texttt{Structural component}&:& \texttt{Block}\\
	\texttt{Explanatory component}&:& \texttt{Variety}
\end{eqnarray*}
